# GoldBar-Minimum-Weighing-Algorithm

Given nine gold bars in which all but one are of the same weight, the Minimum Weighing Algorithm will test the fewest number of times the 
nine gold bars would need to be weighed in order to determine which one is fake.

The project will be using Selenium to simulate the results through http://ec2-54-208-152-154.compute-1.amazonaws.com/. Java will be used as the
primary programming language on Eclipse IDE.
